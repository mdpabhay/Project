Introduction
Fake news has become a significant problem, spreading misinformation and misleading readers. This project addresses this issue by using a machine learning model to classify articles as either "Real" or "Fake" and provides a credibility rating for each article.

Features
High Accuracy: Logistic Regression model with over 90% accuracy in detecting fake news.
Real-Time Analysis: Processes and rates each article in under 1 second.
Credibility Score: Provides a rating for each article, indicating the likelihood of it being real or fake.
User-Friendly Interface: Built with Flask for easy article uploads and instant feedback.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Machine Learning: Logistic Regression, Scikit-Learn
Natural Language Processing: Tokenization, TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
Web Framework: Flask
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, NLTK
